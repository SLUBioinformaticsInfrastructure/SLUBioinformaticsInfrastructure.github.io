## The SLU bioinformatics Infrastructure
# Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet - Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences

Our main goal is to provide support and training in bioinformatics for SLU staff, and to build a strong community of bioinformaticians within SLU.
Our staff is located on the 3 SLU campuses in Ultuna, Ume√• and Alnarp.
We want to join forces and coordinate teaching activities, common resources (hardware, software).
