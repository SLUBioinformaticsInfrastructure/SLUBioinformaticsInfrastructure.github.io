### SLUBI computing resources:
We have computing resources at all campuses and will try to coordinate the management of these.
More information coming soon.

### Computing resources for the Swedish research community:
We would like to remind that researchers can get computing resources for free by applying to [SNIC](https://www.snic.se) (Uppmax and other clusters).

### Cloud computing
SLU has an agreement with Microsoft Azure for cloud computing (including price discounts). You can get more information by contacting the [IT-support](https://student.slu.se/en/study-support/it-support/)
