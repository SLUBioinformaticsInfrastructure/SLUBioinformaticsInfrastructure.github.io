Before the pandemics, SLUBI used to organises Bioinformatics drop-in sessions at all 3 campi for answering various Bioinformatics questions around a fika. It is also the opportunity for bioinformaticians to gather and exchange about their experiences. Now the drop-in goes online: all campi at the same place and time!
