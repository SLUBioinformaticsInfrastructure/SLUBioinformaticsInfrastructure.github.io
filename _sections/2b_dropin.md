Before the pandemic, SLUBI organised bioinformatics drop-in sessions at all 3 SLU campuses for answering various bioinformatics questions around a fika. Now the drop-in goes online: all campuses at the same place and time! Come and join us with your questions or take the opportunity to gather and exchange experiences with other bioinformaticians.
